# DATA 3320, Project 1: Quantifying Rain in Seattle and St. Louis
## Overview
This project aims to answer the question: Does it rain more in Seattle, WA, or St. Louis, MO? 

Using daily precipitation measured in Seattle and St. Louis, this project aims to quantify the rain in each city between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2022, and then present that using graphs and tables where necessary.
